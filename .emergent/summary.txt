<analysis>
The previous AI engineer effectively executed the user's request to build and expand the VELES DRIVE platform, following an iterative, feature-driven approach. The process began with clarifying design preferences and swiftly moved to building core frontend and backend infrastructure, including authentication, catalog, ERP, and payment integrations. Key decisions involved leveraging testing agents (, ) for validation and fixing bugs. The engineer prioritized UI/UX and critical functionality, progressively adding complex features like car comparison, multi-vehicle type support, AI-powered recommendations, PWA capabilities, and initiating two-factor authentication. The development trajectory demonstrates a clear progression from foundational setup to a feature-rich application, with regular checkpoints and continuous adaptation to user requests for further development.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on a comprehensive expansion of the VELES DRIVE platform, following a broad instruction from the user. The primary focus areas were:

1.  **AI Integration**: Successfully implemented AI-powered recommendation, assistant, and smart search functionalities. This involved creating new backend modules () with FastAPI endpoints and integrating them into the frontend (, ) using  and an .
2.  **PWA Implementation**: Enabled Progressive Web App capabilities by creating necessary manifest files (, ) and a dedicated  component, integrated into . Minor  import issues were identified and fixed in .
3.  **Authentication Fixes**: Resolved critical issues where the frontend was failing to maintain user authentication status. This involved creating a new  endpoint in  for token verification and updating  and  to correctly handle login, token storage, and user context. This was extensively debugged using console logs and screenshots.
4.  **2FA Implementation (In Progress)**: Initiated the implementation of two-factor authentication. Backend support for 2FA setup, verification, and disabling has been added through a new  module and modifications to  (including the  model and login endpoint). Required Python libraries (, ) were installed. On the frontend, the  component has been created.

The current work left off with the  component created, and the next immediate task is to create the corresponding page () to fully integrate the 2FA settings into the frontend application. All implemented features have undergone backend and frontend testing, with identified issues largely resolved.
