The previous AI engineer diligently followed the user's iterative development requests for the VELES DRIVE platform. The process involved tackling several key features: Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), Additional Services, an enhanced Admin Dashboard, expanded Vehicle Type support, and Telegram Bot integration. For 2FA, the engineer created frontend pages and components, then debugged and fixed a crucial TOTP timing synchronization issue in the backend by increasing the . Additional services involved creating a dedicated frontend page and backend endpoints. The Admin Dashboard saw significant expansion, including fixing duplicate backend routes and resolving frontend authentication rendering issues related to context loading. Vehicle type expansion was primarily a frontend effort, updating the catalog, filters, and navigation. Telegram Bot integration involved creating backend files, endpoints, and integrating with the frontend. The engineer consistently updated  and used testing agents to validate changes. The work flow demonstrates methodical problem-solving, particularly in debugging authentication and routing complexities.

<product_requirements>
The VELES DRIVE platform aims to unify the fragmented automotive market for buyers, dealers, and administrators. Buyers seek smart search, filters, comparison, favorites, and history across diverse vehicle types (cars, motorcycles, boats, planes). Dealers need an integrated ERP system covering inventory, sales, service, finance, reports, project management, customer databases, and personalized offers. Administrators require tools for content moderation, user management, system settings, statistics, and backups. The platform features a premium, minimalist design with a dark theme and gold accents. Existing implementations include UI/backend setup, core pages, ERP sub-components, Premium Catalog, YooKassa payments, Subscriptions, Admin Dashboard, Reviews, Notifications, Telegram Bot, Auction page, Car Comparison, view history, AI recommendations/search/assistant, PWA, and partially implemented 2FA.
