The previous AI engineer effectively executed the user's request to build the VELES DRIVE platform, following an iterative, feature-driven approach. The process began with clarifying design preferences (accent colors) and then swiftly moved to building the core frontend and backend infrastructure. Key decisions included leveraging  for initial rapid prototyping, then incrementally adding features and components. The engineer prioritized UI/UX, integrating image assets and adhering to specific design guidelines. A significant part of the work involved setting up a comprehensive ERP system, premium sections, and critical integrations like YooKassa. The AI consistently used screenshots for validation and managed dependencies. The development trajectory demonstrates a clear progression from foundational setup to a feature-rich application, with regular checkpoints and successful confirmations from the user.
